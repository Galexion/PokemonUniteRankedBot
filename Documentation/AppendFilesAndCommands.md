## Append Files and Commands

# Introduction

Append Files are plugins that Add-on to the current bot's funtionality.

If a command Uses an append that is required, like embed.js, it will be found at the start of the file, like this.

```js
let { match,notFound } = require("./append/embeds")
```
The structure goes like this.

```js
let {needed exports} = require("./append/file")
```

Making your own append files is easy to do, but hard when you start coding your own things.
