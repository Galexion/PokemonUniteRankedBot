# PokeUnite
to help find other people to play ranked with.

This is a development build. (Interaction's)

## Overview
Finding premade matches is hard, even if you have friends that play unite.

There could be diffrering Ranks, People not getting along, and worst of all:

__They could just dip.__

This won't fix all of those problems, but we do aim to fix the first 2, and eliviate the 3rd one.

sadly, we can't provide you with the war materials provided to fight against smurf accounts. All we can do is link you to discord VC's with other people. sorry.
