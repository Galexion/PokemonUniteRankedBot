# ATTN: This project is on hold to relearn Discord.JS for DJS v13.

Why is this?

- Discord.JS v13 requires gateways. gotta calculate what I need for this.
- The Buttons system requires Slash Commands to my knowledge.
- Discord.JS v13 is just WACK lol

## Issues with the code At the Moment

- Profile Creation Script is time based / in Discord itself
- there is no web interface for viewing and setting up a profile.

## How will the website look?

Prototyping will start soon.
