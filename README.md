to help find other people to play ranked with.

# ATTN: This is a experimental build running ERIS.

Why? 

Discord.JS v13 adds features that make things I could do in v12 impossible.

also figuring out intents is wack

This branch will be behind the main release.

## Issues with the code At the Moment

- Profile Creation Script is time based / in Discord itself
- there is no web interface for viewing and setting up a profile.

## How will the website look?

Prototyping will start soon.
