Pokémon Unite Ranked Bot Privacy Policy

This Program takes your public Discord ID to associate you with your Pokémon Unite Ranked Bot Profile.

The bot does does not take any personal infomation, unless you feed it that. PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

Players are able to view your profile, using the pu!profile command, with the search argument, so please avoid putting any personal infomation on your profile.

Even though the bot is open-source, the Profile database (a JSON file) is stored locally on the hosted server / your personal computer, depending on where you host it.

(Side Note, Profiles.json is a temp file for development purposes only.)
